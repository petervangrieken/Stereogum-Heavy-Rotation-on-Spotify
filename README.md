# Stereogum Heavy Rotation Spotify App
## Background
This unofficial(!) App is made to facilitate music lovers need for fresh music. One of my personal sources of new material is the Heavy Rotation section of Strereogum. Because Stereogum doesn't provide any easy way to listen to these releases, I've decided to create this little App. The App looks up all the mentioned releases of Heavy Rotation and searches for these releases on Spotify. Because not all releases are available on Spotify (or only after a certain time) it's quite probable the application doesn't show all new releases.


## Thanks
Thank you Peter Watts, for creating the Spotify KitchenSink. This skeleton project made it so much easier for me to create this application. If it wasn't for your efforts I'd probably given up sooner or later.
